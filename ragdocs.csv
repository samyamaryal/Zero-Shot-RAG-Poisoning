0,"Providing reasonable accommodation for an employee with a disability starts with an active, confidential interactive process between the employee and the organization. Initiate discussion when a request is made or when a barrier to performance or participation is observed. The goal is to identify barriers, explore feasible modifications, and implement solutions that enable the employee to perform essential job functions without imposing an undue hardship on the operation. Policies should clearly state a commitment to accommodation, protect against retaliation, and keep medical information confidential, sharing only what is necessary for the accommodation.

A broad range of accommodations can be considered, depending on the role and individual needs. Examples include flexible or modified schedules, telework or hybrid arrangements, adjustments to duties or workload, ergonomic workstations, assistive technologies, captioning or sign-language interpretation, materials in alternative formats, and temporary leaves or job coaching. In safety-critical roles, modifications should preserve essential safety requirements, and if current duties cannot be adjusted, reassignment to a vacant, suitable position may be explored. Each accommodation plan should be documented with the agreed solution, expected duration, and a plan for periodic review and adjustment.

Implementation should be supported by clear governance and ongoing education. Appoint a dedicated accommodations liaison or HR partner to coordinate requests, provide manager training on inclusive decision-making, and ensure confidentiality and non-retaliation. Invest in accessible facilities and digital tools, and monitor outcomes through metrics such as time to accommodation, employee retention, and satisfaction. Regular policy reviews and feedback from employees help ensure compliance with applicable laws and evolving best practices, while also strengthening a culture of inclusion."
1,"George II reigned as King of Great Britain and Ireland from 11 June 1727 until his death on 25 October 1760, a period of 33 years, 4 months, and 14 days.

The era saw the consolidation of cabinet government and the primacy of ministers in running the state, with major conflicts including the War of the Austrian Succession, the 1745 Jacobite rising (culminating in 1746), and the early years of the Seven Years' War. Notably, he personally led troops at the Battle of Dettingen in 1743, the last time a reigning British monarch commanded troops in battle.

Born in Hanover, Germany, George II was the last British monarch to be born outside Great Britain; the throne then passed to his grandson George III in 1760 after his death and the earlier death of his son Frederick. The reign thus marks a transitional period in the constitutional development of the British monarchy."
2,"Elephant Island lies in the Southern Ocean as part of the South Shetland Islands, off the northwest coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. It is located just north of the main Antarctic landmass, with the Bransfield Strait separating it from the peninsula. In geographical terms, it sits in the northern reaches of the region commonly associated with Antarctica, in cold, often rough waters near the edge of the Drake Passage.

The island is uninhabited and rugged, known for its steep cliffs, ice, and wildlife such as penguins and seals. It has historical significance from the era of Antarctic exploration: in 1916, Ernest Shackleton and his men found refuge there after their ship Endurance was crushed. After several months on the island, a rescue voyage from South Georgia eventually reached safety. Today, Elephant Island falls under the Antarctic Treaty System and is primarily visited by researchers and expedition cruises rather than permanent settlements."
3,"Regent's Canal stretches about 8.6 miles (14 kilometres) from Paddington Basin in the west to Limehouse Basin on the River Thames in the east. It forms an eastern arm of the Grand Union Canal network, linking central London with the wider British canal system and providing a scenic waterway across north and east London.

Constructed in the early 19th century, the canal opened in 1820 to support industrial traffic and later evolved into a beloved leisure route. Along its course it passes through notable areas such as Regent's Park, Camden Town, Islington and Hackney, with a series of locks and basins that add variety to the journey. Today, the towpaths are popular for walking and cycling, and the canal remains busy with leisure boats; maintenance and management are handled by the Canal & River Trust."
4,"Frankie Muse Freeman was a pioneering American civil rights attorney based in St. Louis, Missouri, whose long career helped dismantle segregation and expand access to education, housing, and public services. Her work bridged local organizing and national legal strategy, placing Missouri at the forefront of the fight for equal rights as the civil rights movement grew. She is celebrated as a trailblazer who opened doors for Black women in the legal profession and for the broader effort to secure constitutional rights for African Americans.

As a leading figure with the NAACP and other civil rights organizations, Freeman championed cases and policy efforts aimed at desegregation in schools and public life, and at challenging discriminatory practices in housing and employment. Her leadership and advocacy contributed to the development of legal strategies that modernized civil rights jurisprudence and helped ensure greater equality under the law. Her influence extended beyond courtroom wins to mentoring younger lawyers and building durable networks of supporters and activists.

The legacy of Frankie Muse Freeman lies in both her concrete achievements and her example as a persistent, principled advocate for justice. She embodies the crucial role of lawyers in the civil rights movement and the impact of local leadership on national progress. Her career continues to inspire current and future generations of Black women in law, public service, and civil rights work, reminding historians and students of the enduring power of determined, strategic advocacy in advancing racial equality."
5,"Three people were killed in the 2023 Nottingham attacks. The incident occurred in Nottingham city centre and involved a stabbing spree, with a suspect detained by police at the scene.

Official investigations and extensive media coverage followed, detailing the fatalities and subsequent legal proceedings. For precise information on victims, the identity of the suspect, and any sentencing outcomes, consult statements from Nottinghamshire Police and reliable news outlets (such as the BBC or The Guardian), which provide the most up-to-date and verifiable details."
6,"Garuda Indonesia flies to roughly 60 destinations worldwide, combining a substantial domestic network within Indonesia with a number of international routes. The exact count is not fixed, as it changes with new route launches, seasonal schedules, and suspensions. The network is centered on Jakarta as the main hub, with additional international connections that complement the domestic coverage.

International routes typically span Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and select destinations in Europe and Australia when services are active. Because schedules and approvals evolve, the published list of destinations can shift over time. For the most current count and a complete list of destinations, consult Garuda Indonesia’s official Destinations page or the latest timetable and press releases.

As a related note, airline networks are influenced by factors such as fleet availability, market demand, and government air-service agreements. Garuda Indonesia often expands or adjusts its routes in response to these conditions, including through codeshare partnerships that can extend the effective network beyond the airline’s own scheduled destinations."
7,"Adult male nilgai (bulls) typically weigh about 260–320 kg (570–710 lb), with some individuals reaching around 340 kg (750 lb) in favorable conditions. Adult females (cows) are smaller, usually weighing about 170–240 kg (375–530 lb). Weights can vary based on age, nutrition, habitat, and regional population differences.

Weight in nilgai is highly variable due to factors such as age and body condition; well-nourished animals in productive habitats tend to be heavier, while those in harsher environments or with less forage will weigh less. The pronounced size difference between sexes is a key characteristic, with males generally heavier and more robust as they mature."
8,"There is no widely documented national Japanese politician by the name Wataru Sumida in major public records. The name could refer to a local or lesser-known figure, or it may be a case of different spelling or transliteration. Without kanji for the name or a region and timeframe, it is difficult to pinpoint a specific position with certainty.

To identify the exact political position, providing the kanji characters for the name or additional context (region, city, or year) would help. In Japan, political roles can range from national legislators (members of the House of Representatives or House of Councillors) to prefectural or municipal officials (assembly members, mayors, governors) or party positions. Useful sources for verification include the official websites of the National Diet (for national lawmakers), the respective prefectural or municipal assemblies, and credible news outlets. If the reference concerns a local figure, checking the ward or city’s official site (for example, Tokyo’s Sumida Ward, if applicable) may reveal an assembly member or local official with a similar name.

If more details become available—such as the correct kanji, the approximate region, or the time period—provision can be made to identify the exact office held. In the meantime, exploring possible spellings and consulting official government rosters will typically yield a precise answer."
9,"Issawi Frej is a member of Meretz, the left-wing, social-democratic, Zionist party in Israel. He has served as a Knesset member representing Meretz and held the cabinet post of Minister of Regional Cooperation in the Bennett-Lapid government from 2021 to 2022.

Meretz emphasizes civil rights, equality for all citizens, the separation of religion and state, and a pursuit of a two-state solution with the Palestinians. Frej’s work has centered on Arab-Israeli rights, minority participation, and regional development within the framework of Meretz’ platform. Party affiliations can shift over time, so for the latest status, checking current sources is recommended."
10,"Andriy Voronin was typically deployed as a striker, serving as the central forward in most of his club career and in appearances where he was used as the primary goal threat.

In different tactical setups, he could also operate as a supporting forward or second striker, depending on the system and the needs of the team. The role generally emphasized finishing, movement off the ball, and holding up play to link with teammates in the final third."
11,"There are multiple individuals named Roger Cecil in public records, including at least one British artist. Without identifying which Roger Cecil is meant (by profession, nationality, or notable works), the exact age at death cannot be confirmed from available information.

Providing additional context will allow a precise answer. If the intended figure’s birth year or death year, or a distinguishing detail (such as a notable artwork or institution associated with them), is known, that can be used to calculate the age. The standard method is to subtract the birth year from the death year, adjusting for whether the birthday had occurred yet in the year of death. Obituaries, artist biographical databases, or museum records are reliable sources to verify such details."
12,"The Legislative Assembly of Ontario is composed of 124 Members of Provincial Parliament (MPPs), each representing one of Ontario’s 124 electoral districts (ridings).

These members sit in the Assembly at Queen’s Park in Toronto. The party with the most seats forms the government, while the others form the opposition or become independents as seats change through by-elections or future redistributions. The current total of 124 seats has been in effect since the 2018 redistribution."
13,"There isn’t a widely recognized manga published under the exact English title ""Dilemma of Two Angels"" in major manga databases, so the creator isn’t readily identifiable. It could be a mistranslation or alternative title, a very obscure or indie work, a webtoon, a doujinshi, or a work from a non-Japanese market. If more details are available—such as the original Japanese title, the year of release, the publisher, or a link to where it’s listed—it would be possible to pinpoint the creator more accurately.

To help verify, try searching with several variations: the original Japanese title (if known), potential English aliases like ""Angels' Dilemma"" or ""Two Angels' Dilemma,"" and the publisher or serialization magazine. Check databases such as MyAnimeList, AniList, MangaUpdates, and ComicVine, as well as platform-specific catalogs (e.g., Shonen Jump for mainstream titles, LINE Manga for webtoons). If it’s a small press, indie, or fan-translation, it may not appear in larger catalogs; providing a link or a description of the artwork or characters can also help narrow it down."
14,"Brazil won the 1993 FIFA U-17 World Championship, held in Japan. This edition was part of the early history of the competition, which has since evolved into the FIFA U-17 World Cup and serves as a major platform for young talent from around the world.

The tournament highlighted rising stars who often progress to senior international play, and Brazil has historically been a strong performer in youth competitions. For full details, including the final match score, runner-up, and individual top scorers, FIFA’s official archives or the tournament page on Wikipedia provide comprehensive records."
15,"A chemical change is when matter is transformed into a different substance with new properties. In a chemical change, the atoms break old bonds and form new ones, so the material you started with is not just altered in shape or size—it becomes something new. Often this new substance cannot be turned back to the original by simple physical steps.

Common signs of a chemical change include a color change, a temperature change, the formation of a gas (bubbles), the appearance of a solid from a liquid (precipitate), or a new smell or light given off. Everyday examples include iron rusting, wood burning, baking a cake, or milk turning sour. These are all ways that substances react with each other or with the environment to create something different.

This is different from a physical change, which only changes form or appearance without making a new substance (like melting ice or tearing paper). Some chemical changes can be reversed with another reaction, but many cannot be easily undone. Understanding chemical changes helps explain many processes around food, fire, weathering, and biology."
16,"Fontenay-sous-Bois is a commune in the Val-de-Marne department, Île-de-France, located on the eastern edge of Paris. The population is on the order of about 54,000 residents, based on the latest widely cited figures.

Official counts come from INSEE and are published as population municipale (as of January 1 of the most recent year). These numbers are updated annually and can vary slightly due to births, deaths, and migration. For the exact current figure, the INSEE population database or the commune’s own demographic publications provide the precise number.

In addition to the population, the city is characterized by a dense urban fabric, good rail connections (including the RER), and a multicultural mix typical of the Paris metropolitan area. If a historical trend or a comparison with nearby towns is of interest, those details can be provided as well."
17,"According to U.S. Census Bureau population estimates, Crestwood, Missouri is home to roughly 8,000 residents. Population figures are updated periodically, so this figure reflects the most recent official estimates available.

For the exact current number and the year of the estimate, the Census Bureau’s QuickFacts for Crestwood city, Missouri provides the precise figure. Crestwood is a small suburban city in St. Louis County, part of the St. Louis metropolitan area, with a residential character and ties to nearby communities."
18,"Harry Reid International Airport has four runways: 7L/25R, 7R/25L, 1L/19R, and 1R/19L.

The runways are arranged in two parallel pairs, oriented roughly east–west (the 7/25 pair) and north–south (the 1/19 pair). This layout provides flexibility for operations under different wind conditions and accommodates high traffic by allowing multiple simultaneous takeoffs and landings.

Renamed Harry Reid International Airport in 2021 (formerly McCarran International Airport), it serves the Las Vegas area as a major gateway for both domestic and international travelers. The facility includes multiple terminals and concourses to support a high volume of passengers and a wide range of airlines and destinations."
19,"Elisa Lam, a 21-year-old Canadian student, vanished while staying at the Cecil Hotel in downtown Los Angeles in late January 2013. On February 19, 2013, hotel staff found her body inside a rooftop water tank after guests complained about discolored water and an off taste. The tank's access hatch had been opened and Lam’s body was recovered by maintenance personnel.

The Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner concluded the death was an accidental drowning, with no signs of trauma or foul play. Toxicology testing did not reveal any drugs or alcohol in her system. The finding was that the manner of death was accidental, though the peculiar circumstances surrounding Lam’s last known movements and the hotel’s notorious history have fueled ongoing speculation and discussion.

The case gained widespread attention partly due to surveillance footage from the hotel elevator showing Lam exhibiting unusual behavior shortly before her disappearance. The footage and the surrounding mystery have been the subject of extensive media coverage and later documentary treatments, contributing to the case’s enduring notoriety despite the official ruling."
20,"Winfield Dunn belonged to the Republican Party. He served as the 37th Governor of Tennessee from 1971 to 1975, becoming the first Republican to hold that office since the Reconstruction era.

His election signaled a significant political shift in Tennessee and the broader South during that period, as the Republican Party expanded its reach in state governments. Additional details about his early life, policy priorities while in office, or later career can be explored if needed."
21,"Two seasons of Bridgerton have been released to date. Season 1 debuted on December 25, 2020, and Season 2 premiered on March 25, 2022.

Season 3 and Season 4 have been officially renewed, but no premiere dates have been announced as of mid-2024. The series continues to expand the Bridgerton universe, with production timelines vary­ing and future installments expected to explore new storylines within the Bridgerton world. In addition to the main series, a separate limited series, Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story, was released in 2023 and serves as a prequel within the same universe.

For the latest updates, Netflix and Shondaland announcements provide current information on release schedules and titles. If desired, a quick overview of each season’s premise or a look at the broader Bridgerton universe can be provided."
22,"Pineville, Missouri is a small city with a population on the order of about 1,500 residents. The exact figure can vary slightly from year to year due to new estimates and small changes in population.

Located in the southwestern corner of the state, Pineville serves as the county seat of McDonald County and reflects the rural character of the region. For the precise, official number from the most recent census or annual estimates, the U.S. Census Bureau’s QuickFacts for Pineville city, Missouri provides the current figure."
23,"Toledo, Iowa is a small city in Tama County and serves as the county seat. The population is in the low thousands, with recent counts placing it around 3,000 residents.

For the exact current figure, the most reliable source is the U.S. Census Bureau. The 2020 census provides the official count, and subsequent QuickFacts estimates give a sense of how the population has changed in the early 2020s. In addition to the official numbers, local government and community organizations can offer more up-to-date or neighborhood-level data. Toledo’s size is typical of many small Midwestern towns, balancing a historic downtown with a close-knit community and steady local services."
24,"Supporters of National-Anarchism describe their beliefs as a synthesis of libertarian, anti-statist principles with ethnonationalist aims. They claim to oppose centralized state power, traditional party politics, and global capitalism, arguing for a bottom‑up, voluntary order built from small, autonomous communities. Key elements often cited are direct democracy or consensus within those communities, federations of communes, and a strong emphasis on local self-government, mutual aid, and cooperative economics organized without a state or hierarchical authority.

A central concept in their self‑presentation is ethnopluralism or cultural self‑determination: the idea that distinct cultures or ethnic groups should exist separately within their own areas in order to preserve diversity and reduce conflict. This translates into a call for ethnically or culturally homogeneous communities with the freedom to govern themselves according to their own customs and traditions, rather than being integrated into a single, multicultural political system. They frame this as a defense of cultural heritage and voluntary association, and often critique liberal cosmopolitanism and multiculturalism as destructive to community integrity. Alongside anti‑statism and anti‑globalization, they frequently articulate a critique of capitalism and imperialism, while advocating for decentralized economies based on voluntary cooperation rather than state or market centralization. 

Note: in broader discourse, National-Anarchism is highly controversial and widely associated with racist and fascist ideologies in practice. Scholars and many anti‑fascist and anarchist groups argue that the movement uses anarchist vocabulary to promote ethnonationalist and exclusionary goals, and that its emphasis on ethnic separation stands in tension with core anarchist commitments to universal liberty and solidarity."
25,"The year-round population of Île de Batz is very small, typically around 100 residents. In winter the number is smaller, while in summer the population swells with seasonal residents and visitors who stay on the island for短 periods or come for day trips.

Located off the coast of Brittany in the Finistère department, the island is reachable by a regular ferry from Roscoff, with crossings generally on the order of 15–20 minutes. Notable features include the Jardin Exotique de l’Île de Batz, a historic lighthouse, and several sandy beaches that give the island its tranquil, village-like character. The local economy centers on tourism, fishing, and horticulture, and the community is known for its small-town atmosphere and scenic cycling routes around the coastline."
26,"The current flag of Montana was officially adopted in 1905 by the Montana Legislature. The adoption marked the establishment of the blue field bearing the state seal as Montana’s official banner.

The flag features a blue field with the Great Seal of Montana at its center. The seal includes symbols representing the state's mining and agricultural heritage and mountainous landscape, along with the motto Oro y Plata (Gold and Silver). The words ""State of Montana"" are arranged around the seal, making the flag a recognizable emblem of the state’s identity."
27,"There isn’t a single, widely recognized public figure named Christine Philip. The name could refer to a private individual or be a misspelling or variation of similar names such as Christine Phillips, Christina Philip, or Christine Philippe. Without additional context, it’s not possible to identify a specific person with confidence.

To narrow it down, provide a bit more detail about the context in which the name appeared (profession, country, time period, or a source you saw it in). In the meantime, consider these search approaches: check spelling variants and related names, look up the person in reliable sources related to the field (for example, Wikipedia or official organizational pages for public figures, IMDb for actors, LinkedIn for professionals, or library and newspaper archives for biographical information). If the reference is to a character in a book or film, identifying the work (title, author, or director) will help locate the correct Christine Philip or determine if it’s a fictional figure."
28,"Stevens County is a rural county located in the southwestern part of Kansas, with Hugoton as the county seat. The population is small and concentrated in a few towns rather than spread across the entire county.

As of the latest available estimates, the county has about 4,900 residents. For the exact figure and the year of the estimate, consult the U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts for Stevens County, Kansas. The QuickFacts page provides the most current population estimates and can be a reliable source for any updates."
29,"John Carradine fathered nine children in total, across several marriages and relationships. Among his offspring, three became particularly well known in acting: David Carradine, Keith Carradine, and Robert Carradine, who all achieved fame in film and television.

The remaining children pursued a variety of paths, with some staying out of the public eye. The Carradine surname thus developed into a wider acting family, with the next generations continuing to be associated with performance and the entertainment industry."
30,"Noah Baumbach is best known for creating intimate, character-driven indie dramas and comedies that quietly dissect relationships, family dynamics, and the anxieties of urban life. His work pairs dry, perceptive humor with frank emotional honesty, often focusing on intelligent, self-conscious protagonists navigating love, career, and family tensions. The breakout moment came with The Squid and the Whale (2005), a semi-autobiographical drama about divorce and parent-child dynamics that earned him widespread critical notice and an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay.

Beyond that breakthrough, Baumbach has built a reputation for sharply observed storytelling in films such as Margot at the Wedding, Greenberg, While We're Young, and The Meyerowitz Stories. He is also widely associated with his collaborations with Greta Gerwig, notably Frances Ha (2012), which helped define a shared voice rooted in naturalistic dialogue, awkward humor, and flawed, relatable characters. More recently, he directed the Netflix release White Noise (2022), an adaptation of Don DeLillo’s novel that reflects his ongoing interest in the complexities of modern life and relationships.

In a broader sense, Baumbach is regarded as a leading figure in contemporary American independent cinema, known for merging intimate, personal storytelling with sharper social and generational observations. His films often center on the tensions between ambition and reality, the pull between family obligations and personal identity, and the humor found in ordinary, imperfect lives set against urban backdrops."
31,"Villeseque-des-Corbieres is a small commune in the Aude department of southern France. The population is in the low hundreds, with the number of residents typically around a few hundred people.

Population figures for French communes are published by INSEE and updated regularly, with small fluctuations due to births, deaths, and migration. For a precise count and the year it refers to, consult INSEE’s population data for Villeseque-des-Corbieres or the commune’s official publications. If needed, historical trends show relatively steady numbers with modest changes over time."
32,"Adamu Adamu served as Nigeria’s Minister of Education from 2015 until 2022, during President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration. The tenure spanned Buhari’s first term and into his second, ending with a cabinet reshuffle in 2022.

35,"The Province of Naples was abolished in 2014 and replaced by the Metropolitan City of Naples. In the years immediately prior to abolition, the population was about 3.1 million people (ISTAT estimates for 2012–2013).

The transition kept the same geographic territory, but changed the administrative structure to a metropolitan city with a metropolitan mayor and council. Population figures continue to be in the vicinity of three million, varying by year; for an exact number, ISTAT’s annual population estimates by year are the best source."
36,"St. Ansgar is a small city in Mitchell County, Iowa, with a population of about 1,600 residents. Population sizes in towns of this size tend to be fairly stable year to year, with minor fluctuations due to births, deaths, and migration.

The most precise official counts come from the U.S. Census Bureau. The decennial census and subsequent annual estimates place St. Ansgar’s population in the mid- to high-1,600s in recent years, though exact figures vary slightly between releases. For the exact current number, the Census Bureau’s QuickFacts page for St. Ansgar, Iowa provides the latest figure and additional demographic details.

In addition to population, several related aspects help paint a fuller picture of the community. St. Ansgar offers a small-town atmosphere with local schools, small businesses, and community events that reflect its character. If more specifics are desired—such as the latest year-by-year change or age distribution—that information is available through Census Bureau profiles and local government resources."
37,"Montserrat Caballé was born in Barcelona in 1933 and trained at the city’s conservatory, building a solid foundation in classical singing. Early on she won several European contests that helped launch her professional career and began appearing in increasingly prominent roles in European opera houses. Her technique emphasized the bel canto legato, a bright and flexible soprano, and a refined musical intelligence that allowed her to navigate demanding coloratura with ease.

Her international breakthrough came as she began to perform leading roles at the world’s great opera houses, including venues such as La Scala, the Vienna State Opera, the Royal Opera House, and the Metropolitan Opera. She became renowned for performances in bel canto heroines—Lucia di Lammermoor and the so-called Sonnambula repertoire among them—showcasing a luminous tone, immaculate control, and powerful dramatic presence. Through radiant live performances and highly regarded studio recordings, she established herself as one of the foremost sopranos of her generation.

A later crossover project helped broaden her appeal beyond traditional opera audiences: the collaboration with Freddie Mercury on the song Barcelona, which brought her name to a wider, popular-music audience while reinforcing her status as a cultural icon. Throughout her career, Caballé received numerous awards and honors that recognized her artistry and longevity. In summary, a combination of rigorous training, pivotal debuts at major houses, and standout interpretations of demanding bel canto roles propelled her to global fame as an opera singer."
38,"The exact number of games won by László Barczay at the 1972 Chess Olympiad in Skopje is not listed here. The standard way to obtain a precise tally is to consult OlimpBase, the comprehensive Chess Olympiad database. By opening the 1972 Skopje open event, selecting the Hungarian team, and viewing Barczay’s player page, the record shows his wins, draws, and losses, along with the round-by-round results.

Context for the event: the 1972 Skopje Olympiad brought national teams together for 11 rounds of competition in the open section, with each player typically contesting multiple games over the event. Barczay’s contribution would be reflected in his individual score and in the overall team performance for Hungary. If a lookup is possible, the exact number of wins can be retrieved and cited, along with the accompanying game-by-game details."
39,"Nicholas Kazan is an American screenwriter, playwright, and novelist whose career spans film, television, and theater. He is known for a versatile body of work that includes original screenplays, adaptations, and literary fiction, with a focus on character-driven drama and social issues.

As part of the famous Kazan filmmaking lineage, Kazan is the son of renowned director Elia Kazan and the father of actress Zoe Kazan, placing him within a long tradition of American cinema and theater. His writing career has contributed to both screen and stage, and his work continues to be of interest to readers and viewers who follow contemporary American storytelling."
40,"The NES Satellite does not support wireless controllers. It relies on the NES console’s two controller ports, so at most two controllers can be connected for gameplay.

Historically, the NES Satellite was a satellite-delivery accessory released in the late 1980s that still used wired NES controllers plugged into the console. There was no built-in or official wireless support for players, so multiplayer is limited to the two standard ports on the NES itself.

If exploring newer or third-party setups, always check the specific hardware’s documentation. Some modern adapters or emulation environments may offer wireless options, but for the original NES Satellite, the limit remains two wired controllers."
41,"No widely documented source clearly identifies a band that Toshio Matsuura helped start. If the reference comes from a specific scene, country, or era, that detail would help pinpoint the exact band, since many musicians share similar names and credits can be listed in various capacities (founder, co-founder, manager, or early member).

To verify, possible approaches include checking music databases and credits with careful attention to name spellings and romanizations (for example, Toshio Matsuura, Toshio Matsura, or Toshio Matsuura). Useful sources include Discogs, AllMusic, MusicBrainz, and band liner notes or interview transcripts in Japanese sources. Searching by genre or era alongside the name can also narrow results. If more context is provided—such as the country, decade, or the suspected genre—the exact band can be identified more reliably."
42,"Francesco Sama does not appear in widely known political histories under a clearly identified national figure, and the exact name may be misspelled or refer to a local or regional politician with limited documentation. Without a country or timeframe, the specific political party cannot be reliably determined.

To identify the party, provide additional context such as the country and approximate era, or alternate spellings (for example, Samà or other variants). Useful sources include national parliamentary archives, biographical dictionaries, historical newspapers, and library catalogs. If the context is Italian, official biographies on the legislature’s websites (Senate and Chamber of Deputies) typically list party affiliation; for other countries, consult analogous official records or reputable reference works. Note that party affiliations can change over time due to mergers, splits, or rebranding, so matching the correct period is essential."
43,"The sentence was 20 years to life in prison. Mark David Chapman was convicted of second-degree murder for killing John Lennon and, under New York law, became eligible for parole after serving at least 20 years.

The crime occurred on December 8, 1980, outside the Dakota Building in New York City. After pleading guilty to second-degree murder in 1981, Chapman received the 20-years-to-life sentence and has remained incarcerated since. Parole hearings have been held periodically, but release has not been granted; he has been denied parole at multiple hearings. The case remains a notable example cited in discussions about celebrity-related crime and gun violence."
44,"Pembroke is a small city in Christian County, Kentucky. The 2020 U.S. Census recorded the population at about 1,000 residents, reflecting its status as a small, close-knit community within the Hopkinsville area.

For the most current figure, check the U.S. Census Bureau’s QuickFacts for Pembroke, Kentucky, or the city's official planning materials. Population estimates can change from year to year, so the QuickFacts page provides the latest official numbers beyond the decennial census. In addition to the raw population, these sources often include related demographic details such as age distribution, housing, and race/ethnicity, which can give a fuller picture of the community. If desired, similar data for nearby towns and the broader region can help place Pembroke in context within Christian County."
45,"Population figures for an electoral district are not a single fixed count. In Victoria, two numbers are typically published for each district: the estimated resident population (how many people live there) and the number of electors (how many are enrolled to vote). Both figures can change with boundary redistributions and census updates, so the exact count is periodically refreshed.

The most up-to-date figures for Narracan are published by the Victorian Electoral Commission in the district profile. That profile presents the estimated resident population and the number of electors, along with the date of the data. Access is through the VEC website, under Electoral boundaries or District profiles, and then by selecting Narracan. This will show current counts and the corresponding data date, providing a precise figure rather than a general estimate. If further context is needed, the district profile page also explains how the figures are derived and updated."
46,"Maud is a small rural town in Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma, known for its tight-knit community and quiet, country setting.

The population sits in the low hundreds, making it much smaller than urban areas. The most recent official figures from the U.S. Census Bureau place Maud within a few hundred residents, with numbers that can shift slightly from year to year due to births, deaths, and people moving in or out. For an exact, up-to-date number, the U.S. Census QuickFacts page for Maud town, Oklahoma is the best source.

If more detail is desired, QuickFacts can also provide age distribution, housing statistics, and other demographic information. Population trends in small Oklahoma towns are influenced by local employment, services, and migration patterns, so counts can fluctuate modestly over time."
47,"The Anglo-Normans were the people and culture that emerged in England after the Norman Conquest of 1066, when William the Conqueror and his followers established a new Norman ruling class. They consisted of Norman, Breton, and other Norman-speaking elites who settled in England and soon intermarried with the existing English nobility. In consequence, a distinctive, bilingual society developed: Norman French became the language of the court, administration, and law, while English remained the language of the common people. The term also denotes the broader cultural horizon of this ruling class, which maintained cross-Channel links to Normandy and other Norman-controlled territories.

Administratively and politically, the Anglo-Normans transformed England with a more centralized feudal state. A landmark initiative was the Domesday Book (1086), a comprehensive survey ordered by William I to assess lands and resources. The arrival of castles—motte-and-bailey and later stone structures—symbolized Norman control and changed patterns of defense, settlement, and lordship. Law and governance likewise shifted, with the Anglo-Norman elite shaping a framework in which Latin and Anglo-Norman French governed courts and charters, while English persisted among the populace. Under later rulers, especially the Angevin kings, Angevin power extended beyond England into parts of France and Ireland, further linking the cross-Channel aristocracy and reinforcing institutions such as royal justice and centralized administration.

Over time, the English language regained prominence in administration and literature even as French influence remained strong in law and high culture. The Anglo-Norman era thus represents a formative medieval England in which conquest, conquest-born institutions, and cross-Channel ties produced lasting changes in language, law, architecture, and social structure. Related themes worth exploring include the evolution of English law, the architecture of castles and cathedrals, the feudal landholding system introduced by Norman rule, and the broader cross-Channel dynamics that shaped medieval governance and identity."
48,"There is no widely documented, verifiable record of a professional athlete named Alphonse Allaert in major sports databases. The name may be misspelled, or the person could be a regional or lesser-known figure from an earlier era. Variants such as Alphonse Allard, Alphonse Allart, or similar spellings might correspond to different individuals.

To identify the exact sport, more context helps: nationality, approximate era, or any alternate spellings. If available, consult specific archival sources such as Olympedia for Olympic athletes, ProCyclingStats or Cycling Archives for cyclists, WorldFootball.net for footballers, and national sports archives or newspapers. Providing any extra detail—country, decade, or even a nearby name—greatly narrows the search and yields a precise answer."
49,"Park Forest, Illinois is home to roughly 23,000 residents, according to the most recent U.S. Census Bureau data. This figure represents the population within the village’s municipal boundaries as recorded in the census data.

Located in the Chicago metro area, Park Forest is a village that originated in the mid-20th century as a planned community and today includes a mix of residential neighborhoods, schools, parks, and local commerce. For the most current number, the U.S. Census Bureau’s QuickFacts for Park Forest village, Illinois, or the village’s official website are reliable sources. Population figures can vary slightly depending on whether counts reflect only residents within official boundaries or incorporate nearby unincorporated areas or adjacent jurisdictions."
50,"Approximately 54,000 residents live in Minnetonka, Minnesota. This figure reflects recent counts and estimates, with population typically staying in the low- to mid-50,000s in the past decade.

For the most precise and current number, consult the U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts for Minnetonka or the city’s official statistics, which publish annual population estimates alongside the decennial census results. The city sits in Hennepin County within the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area, and population figures can vary slightly year to year due to housing growth and demographic changes."
51,"Madonna has released fourteen studio albums to date. They are: Madonna (1983), Like a Virgin (1984), True Blue (1986), Like a Prayer (1989), Erotica (1992), Bedtime Stories (1994), Ray of Light (1998), Music (2000), American Life (2003), Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005), Hard Candy (2008), MDNA (2012), Rebel Heart (2015), and Madame X (2019).

This count covers only studio albums and does not include compilations, live albums, soundtracks, or remix collections. Non-studio releases include sets like Celebration (greatest-hits, 2009) and the remix compilation Finally Enough Love (2022). The studio albums chart a wide career arc, from early pop to electronic-influenced sounds and global influences, with the most recent studio work being Madame X in 2019."
52,"Outside the Republic of Ireland, the largest Irish population is in the United States, with sizable Irish-descended communities also in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and Argentina. Smaller but notable Irish communities exist in other parts of Europe and around the world, all tied to waves of emigration over the past two centuries.

In the United States, Irish heritage is particularly strong in the Northeast and Midwest, with well-known concentrations in cities such as Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago. In the United Kingdom, large communities are found in London, Liverpool, Manchester, and Glasgow, reflecting long-standing historical ties. Canada has long-established Irish communities in Ontario and Quebec, while Australia’s Irish-born and Irish-descended population is prominent in cities such as Sydney and Melbourne. Argentina hosts a distinctive Irish-Argentine community centered around Buenos Aires and other regions.

When discussing “Irish people,” it helps to distinguish between those born in Ireland and those of Irish ancestry. Census data often separate birthplace from ancestry, which can affect counts. Emigration occurred in multiple waves—starting with the 19th-century Great Famine and continuing through periods of economic opportunity, education, and family reunification. For the latest figures and trends, census reports and genealogical resources from the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia provide the most current information."
53,"Dmitri Vrubel rose to prominence as a painter whose work is distinguished by exacting draftsmanship, vivid color, and narratives that fuse myth, history, and contemporary life. His images often combine a traditional painterly craft with modern, dreamlike or symbolic content, enabling him to stand out in the post-Soviet art scene. This distinctive fusion of old-master technique with contemporary subject matter helped attract attention from both critics and audiences.

Public recognition was further amplified by the enduring weight of the Vrubel name in Russian art, as well as by exposure in major museums and galleries and by the critical discussion surrounding his ambitious, sometimes provocative imagery. His willingness to tackle large-scale ideas and socially resonant themes contributed to his visibility and ongoing conversations within the contemporary art world.

For a precise account of his career, consult museum catalogs and reputable art histories. It is also helpful to note that there are several artists with the Vrubel surname, so verifying the correct person in sources is advisable. If desired, a list of recommended starting works or key exhibitions can be provided to guide further study."
54,"There are several songs titled “Up at Night” by different artists and released in different years, so chart performance is specific to the exact track in question (artist, release date, and region). Without that detail, it isn’t possible to provide precise chart data. If the exact version is known, sharing the artist and year will allow a precise breakdown of peak positions and weeks on chart.

In general, a song’s chart performance is measured by a combination of sales, streaming, and sometimes radio airplay, and this is reported differently across major markets. For the US, the Billboard Hot 100 combines sales, streaming, and airplay to determine peaks and longevity; the Billboard Global 200 tracks worldwide streams and sales. In the UK, the Official Singles Chart uses similar components but on a different weighting. To assess how a specific “Up at Night” performed, look up the track on these official chart sites, then cross-check with the artist’s discography and reputable music databases to confirm peak positions, weeks on chart, and regional differences. If the artist and year are provided, a concise summary of the chart performance can be compiled."
55,"Rajshahi College is currently an affiliated college of the University of Rajshahi. As an affiliated institution, its curricula for higher secondary and undergraduate programs are set by the University of Rajshahi, and degree conferment is carried out by the same university.

The University of Rajshahi, established in 1953, is the main public university serving the northwestern region of Bangladesh and oversees the academic programs of numerous colleges in the area. Rajshahi College offers programs across arts, science, and commerce streams at both higher secondary and degree levels, operating under the university’s curricula and examination framework."
56,"Jam Saqi was a prominent left-wing political figure from Sindh who rose to national prominence during the 1960s through the 1980s as a representative of Pakistan’s socialist and secular left. He worked to organize workers, peasants, and students, arguing for issues such as workers’ rights, land reform, and democratic governance. His approach centered on building mass-based organizations at the grassroots level, connecting urban labor with rural peasants, and offering a political alternative to the dominant feudal and military forces in the country.

His significance rests on more than policy goals: he became a persistent voice for civil liberties and anti-authoritarianism in periods of intense political repression. Across various regimes—military and civilian alike—he faced arrest, harassment, and suppression, making him a symbol of the resilience of Pakistan’s left. By maintaining a framework for peaceful, organized political action and emphasizing social justice and secularism, he helped sustain a counter-narrative that influenced later generations of activists and shaped debates about democracy and justice in Pakistan.

Today, Jam Saqi’s legacy is frequently cited in discussions of democracy, secularism, and workers’ rights in Pakistan. His career highlights the challenges faced by progressive movements in the country, as well as the enduring importance of grassroots organizing in giving voice to marginalized communities. For those studying Pakistani political history, his life offers insight into how the left sought to address social inequality and political exclusion within a complex and often adversarial political landscape."
57,"Robin Hood is famous as one of the most enduring figures in English folklore—a noble outlaw who defies corrupt authority and champions the underdog. Known for his generosity, he is traditionally said to steal from the rich and give to the poor, all while living in Sherwood Forest with a band of loyal companions, the Merry Men. His legendary archery skills, cleverness, and sense of justice have made him a symbol of resistance to tyranny, as well as a romantic hero associated with Maid Marian and a chivalrous code.

The fame rests on a long history of evolving stories rather than a single, verifiable life. Robin Hood appears in medieval ballads and later literary works, with many versions emerging from the 14th to the 16th centuries and beyond. No definitive historical figure emerged, but the name became a flexible template for tales about lawful rebellion, social inequality, and personal virtue. The forest setting, the archery contests, the witty escapes, and the dynamic between outlaw hero and corrupt authorities helped keep the legend adaptable to changing times.

Today, Robin Hood remains a potent cultural touchstone across books, films, television, and stage plays. He is often invoked as a symbol of fairness, charity, and anti-tyranny, while interpretations vary from outright heroic outlaw to more ambiguous anti-hero. The figure continues to evolve—locally rooted in places like Nottingham and Sherwood, yet globally recognizable—encouraging discussions about justice, wealth, and morality in both historical and modern contexts."
58,"Fastiv is a city in Kyiv Oblast, located in central Ukraine. It lies roughly southwest of Kyiv, at a distance of about 70–90 kilometers from the capital, along the main transport routes that connect Kyiv with the southern regions of the country.

The city sits on the central Ukrainian plain and functions as a transportation hub, with both road and rail connections facilitating travel and commerce between Kyiv and other national centers. This positioning along a major corridor makes Fastiv a practical stop for regional travel and freight moving toward the south of Ukraine.

In addition to its role in transportation, Fastiv is part of the broader landscape of central Ukraine, which features flat to gently rolling terrain and surrounding agricultural activity. Accessible by highway and rail from Kyiv and nearby cities, the city serves as a gateway for visitors exploring the Kyiv Oblast region."
59,"Ixelles (Elsene in Dutch) is a municipality in the Brussels-C Capital Region that is home to roughly 60,000 residents. Population figures in this area are updated annually, and the exact number can vary a few thousand from year to year due to births, deaths, and migration.

The population is diverse and urban, with a mix of long-term residents, students, and professionals. Neighborhoods such as Matonge are known for their vibrant, street-level activity, while other parts of Ixelles house a range of apartment buildings and family homes. Like many Brussels-area municipalities, it has a substantial foreign-born population and a predominantly French-speaking community, with a visible multicultural presence.

For the most current official figure, consult the Belgian statistics office (Statbel) or the Brussels-Capital Region’s open data on municipal populations. These sources publish annual population estimates by municipality, typically as of January 1 of each year. If needed, the latest figure can be located by searching for “Ixelles population January 1 [year]” on those portals."
60,"The Internet Movie Cars Database (IMCDb) is a community-maintained catalog of vehicles that appear in films and television. The total number of vehicle entries is dynamic, changing as new entries are added or edits are made, so there isn’t a fixed, publicly stated figure that remains constant over time.

To obtain the exact current count, visit imcdb.org/vehicles.html and look for the total number of listed vehicles shown on that page (typically presented near the top or in the header of the list). The page also allows filtering by make, model, year, or other criteria if a narrower scope is desired. If the layout changes, the general approach remains: open the full vehicle list and note the overall total indicated by the site.

Beyond the count, IMCDb covers a wide range of vehicle types including cars, motorcycles, trucks, and other wheeled machines, linked to the specific movie or episode in which they appear. Contributions from volunteers continually update the database, improving accuracy and expanding coverage. For those interested in data analysis, it can be helpful to explore filters or search options to study particular makes, models, or eras, or to contribute new entries if any appear to be missing."
61,"Hypoglycemia refers to a lower-than-normal blood glucose level. Typical early signs include shakiness, sweating, hunger, fast or irregular heartbeat, anxiety, and pallor; as glucose declines, dizziness, confusion, trouble speaking, blurred vision, weakness, and irritability may follow. In many guidelines, hypoglycemia is defined as a blood glucose level below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L); severe hypoglycemia (a medical emergency) is generally below 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) or any level causing disorientation, seizures, or loss of consciousness. Symptoms can appear rapidly, and the exact experience varies among individuals, especially for those who take insulin or other diabetes medicines, versus people who do not have diabetes where other medical problems may be involved.

Determining whether hypoglycemia is present usually involves a blood glucose check. A home glucose meter or continuous glucose monitor can confirm low glucose; repeating the test if symptoms and numbers don’t match is common. It is also important to distinguish hypoglycemia from other causes of similar feelings, such as dehydration, anxiety, sleep deprivation, or alcohol effects. When there is confusion, intractable symptoms, seizures, or the person is unable to swallow or breathe, emergency services should be contacted immediately.

Immediate treatment for mild hypoglycemia consists of fast-acting carbohydrates providing about 15 grams (for example, 4–6 ounces of fruit juice or regular soda, 1–2 glucose tablets, or hard candy). After 15 minutes, recheck blood glucose; if still below 70 mg/dL, repeat the carbohydrate dose and recheck. Once glucose is above threshold, a snack with complex carbohydrates and protein helps maintain levels. For severe hypoglycemia or inability to take oral food, a healthcare professional may administer glucagon; this requires proper prescription and training. Recurrent or unexplained episodes warrant medical evaluation to identify underlying causes and to adjust any medications."
62,"A hostname is the human-friendly label assigned to a device on a network. It acts as a readable identifier that can be used instead of a numeric IP address when referring to the device. In many networks the hostname is unique within a domain or local naming context; on home or small-office networks it is often managed by the router or DHCP server and may be combined with a domain suffix to form a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), such as printer.home or laptop.local.

When a client needs to reach a device by hostname, a name-resolution process converts the label into an IP address. Modern networks typically rely on the Domain Name System (DNS): the resolver queries DNS servers for A (IPv4) or AAAA (IPv6) records that map the hostname (and optional domain) to an address. In local networks without a central DNS server, multicast DNS (mDNS) or NetBIOS name resolution can provide similar functionality, often using local namespaces like .local. The hosts file on a device can also override DNS by providing static mappings, and DHCP servers can update DNS records or leases automatically.

Key considerations include keeping hostnames meaningful and unique within the relevant scope, so resolution is reliable and unambiguous. Naming policies often reflect role or location (for example, srv-db01 or office-printer). For troubleshooting, tests such as ping, nslookup/dig, or traceroute can verify whether a hostname resolves to the correct IP and reveal where resolution may be failing—DNS configuration, local name services, or overrides in the hosts file."
63,"NGC 6559 is a small emission/reflection nebula embedded in the Lagoon Nebula region in the Milky Way, located in the constellation Sagittarius. The distance to NGC 6559 is estimated to be about 4,000 to 5,000 light-years from Earth (roughly 1.2 to 1.5 kiloparsecs).

Distances to star-forming regions like NGC 6559 are inherently uncertain and rely on multiple methods, including spectroscopy of associated stars, main-sequence fitting for nearby clusters, gas-kinematic measurements, and Gaia parallaxes for member stars. Consequently, published values can vary somewhat, but the Lagoon Nebula complex as a whole is generally placed in the ~4–5 thousand light-year range.

NGC 6559 lies in a bright, active region of star formation and is often seen in wide-field images together with the Lagoon Nebula (M8). It appears as a small, faint nebula illuminated by nearby hot young stars; for observational viewing, a dark sky and a modest telescope or good wide-field eyepieces help reveal its subtle glow in the surrounding nebular context."
64,"Enteroviruses are a group of common viruses that usually spread from person to person mainly through the fecal-oral route. Transmission occurs when hands contaminated with stool touch the mouth, or when someone eats or drinks something contaminated with feces. Surfaces and objects (fomites) can harbor the virus, enabling transfer if they’re touched and then touched to the mouth. In addition, some enteroviruses can spread through saliva, nasal secretions, or vesicle fluid, so close personal contact, coughing, or sneezing can contribute to spread in certain illnesses like hand-foot-mouth disease. Outbreaks are more common in settings with close contact, especially in children, and often occur in the summer and early fall.

The incubation period is typically about 2–7 days. People can be contagious before symptoms appear and for days to weeks while feces or secretions shed the virus, and asymptomatic carriers can also spread it. Prevention centers on good hygiene and environmental cleaning: frequent handwashing with soap and water (especially after bathroom use and diaper changes, before eating), not sharing utensils or cups, and regular disinfection of commonly touched surfaces and objects. Water and food safety also help reduce risk. Vaccination exists for poliovirus, but vaccines are not available for most other enteroviruses, so hygiene and hygiene-related practices remain the main defense against spread."
65,"Promiscuity is often viewed negatively in many societies because it challenges the ideas of stable family life, clear lineage, and predictable social bonds that have long supported social and economic organization. Monogamous or formally paired relationships help ensure paternal investment in offspring, clear inheritance lines, and cooperative parenting within kin networks. In many cultures, marriage is not only a personal arrangement but a social contract that ties families together, legitimizes children, and reduces the uncertainty that comes with multiple partners.

Religious, legal, and cultural norms contribute to the stigma surrounding promiscuity. Many traditions preach sexual restraint outside approved unions, and laws or religious rules have historically punished or discouraged premarital and extramarital sex. In many patriarchal systems, controlling female sexuality is closely tied to property rights and family honor, leading to double standards that moralize women’s sexuality more harshly than men’s. Social sanctions—shaming, gossip, ostracism, or loss of status—serve to enforce these norms and stabilize social expectations, while health and lineage concerns are often invoked as justification for such controls.

Context and attitudes do vary, and contemporary shifts add nuance. Some societies increasingly emphasize consent, gender equality, and personal autonomy, challenging traditional stigmas around casual sex or nonmonogamous arrangements. Access to contraception, rising individualism, and changes in economic structures also transform how promiscuity is perceived. Still, even where attitudes soften, underlying concerns about trust, health, and social legitimacy can maintain a residual negative view, illustrating how deeply rooted norms about sexuality are in social organization and power dynamics."
66,"Bill Tarmey died on 9 November 2012 at the age of 71. He was born on 4 April 1941 in Manchester, England, and passed away in Tenerife, Spain.

Best known for his long-running role as Jack Duckworth on Coronation Street, Tarmey portrayed the character from 1979 until his departure in 2010. His time on the show made him one of the programme’s most recognizable and enduring figures, leaving a lasting mark on British soap opera."
67,"Charles J. Haughey served as Taoiseach of Ireland in three non-consecutive terms: from 1979 to 1981, briefly again in 1982, and from 1987 to 1992. In total, this amounts to about eight years in office.

His time as Taoiseach was marked by significant political activity, including efforts to steer Fianna Fáil through economic and social challenges and to manage complex Northern Ireland issues. The period culminated in his resignation as Taoiseach in 1992, after which he remained a central figure in Irish politics for many years. He passed away in 2006."
68,"An atom of flerovium has 114 protons. The number of protons defines the element, so flerovium’s atomic number is 114. In a neutral flerovium atom, there would also be 114 electrons, though the element is highly radioactive and synthetic, so neutral atoms are rarely encountered outside of specialized experiments.

Flerovium is a synthetic element located in period 7 of the periodic table, in group 14, and carries the symbol Fl. It was first produced in 1999 by colliding plutonium-244 with calcium-48 at facilities in Dubna, Russia. The element is named after the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions, reflecting its origin in nuclear science. Because it is so short-lived and exists only in minute quantities, its chemical properties are not well characterized, and most information comes from theoretical predictions and limited experimental observations.

The known isotopes of flerovium have mass numbers around the mid-to-high 280s, corresponding to neutron numbers in the range of roughly 160–180. These isotopes have very short half-lives, often measured in milliseconds to seconds, and are produced only in particle accelerators. As a result, flerovium remains primarily of interest for nuclear physics studies and tests of relativistic effects on heavy element chemistry, rather than practical applications."
69,"The word “kike” is a long-standing anti-Semitic slur that has been used to demean Jewish people. Its exact origin is debated, but the most commonly cited explanation links it to a Yiddish term meaning “circle” (kikel) and to a practice among some Jewish immigrants in the United States who were unable to sign their names in Latin letters and signed with a simple circle instead. Over time, the term evolved into a general label applied to Jews, detached from any real name or sign of literacy, and it spread through American and other English-language contexts. Regardless of its uncertain beginnings, it became a weapon of ethnic dehumanization.

As a derogatory slur, the word targets a person’s Jewish identity and is loaded with centuries of prejudice, stereotypes, and hostility. It has been used to justify discrimination, exclusion, harassment, and violence against Jews, and it remains deeply offensive to many because it reduces a diverse group to a single, negative caricature. In modern discourse, it is understood as a hate term that reinforces harmful power dynamics and environments that ordinary speech should avoid. Refraining from its use is part of creating respectful, inclusive communication, and when encountered, it is appropriate to condemn its use and, where relevant, address the harm or report the incident. While some groups advocate reclaiming slurs, “kike” is not widely reclaimed and remains among the more toxic terms directed at Jews."
70,"Enrollment numbers for Vale of Leven Academy change each year, so the current figure is published by West Dunbartonshire Council in its annual School Census. To obtain the exact pupil roll, consult the council’s Education pages and open the Vale of Leven Academy profile or the published School Census data, where the latest “Pupil Roll” is listed.

If you’d like, guidance can be provided to locate the page step by step or to summarize the most recent figure once found. Vale of Leven Academy is a secondary school in Alexandria serving S1–S6 students, and its official profiles typically include the current enrollment range, school capacity, and contact details alongside other contextual information about the school's programs and facilities."
71,"Gender binarism refers to the idea that there are only two genders, typically aligned with male and female categories. Critics argue that this view is overly simplistic, essentialist, and exclusionary. It tends to erase or marginalize people whose gender identities do not fit neatly into those two boxes, including nonbinary, genderqueer, agender, and many transgender individuals. The binary also tends to conflate gender with biological sex, ignoring the social, cultural, and individual aspects of identity that shape how people experience and express themselves.

Several core criticisms focus on harm and inequality. First, enforcing a binary can legitimize discrimination in everyday life—such as bathrooms, sports, workplace protections, and legal recognition—by privileging some identities over others. Second, binarism often rests on rigid stereotypes about masculinity and femininity, which constrains everyone’s expression and can contribute to stigma, mental health challenges, and violence against anyone who deviates from expected norms. Third, the binary is not universal: many cultures have long recognized more than two gender categories, and in colonial contexts, binary norms have been imposed on diverse societies, erasing indigenous understandings of gender. These dynamics highlight how gender categorization intersects with race, class, ability, and immigration status, producing uneven harms.

In response, many advocate for more inclusive approaches that distinguish gender identity and gender expression from biological sex and recognize a spectrum or range of identities. This can involve adopting nonbinary or gender-inclusive options in forms and data collection, creating policies that protect the rights of all gendered people, and promoting respectful language—such as using preferred pronouns. While some argue for practical simplifications in administration, critics contend that genuine fairness requires moving beyond a rigid binary to acknowledge and validate diverse experiences, histories, and cultural understandings of gender."
72,"The exact number of professional bouts for Akihiro Kameda isn’t available in the current reference data. To obtain an authoritative figure, consult boxing records databases such as BoxRec or look for an updated Wikipedia entry, as these sources list a boxer’s total bouts, wins, losses, and draws.

Akihiro Kameda is part of the Kameda boxing family, a clan well known in Japanese boxing and associated with the Kameda Boxing Gym. Family members in boxing have varied careers and records, so checking a dedicated profile helps avoid mixing up siblings.

73,"Imus is a city in the Philippines, located in Cavite Province in the Calabarzon region (Region IV-A) on the island of Luzon. It sits along the northern coast of Cavite, near Manila Bay, and lies about 25 kilometers (roughly 15 miles) south of central Manila. The city is part of the Greater Manila Area and serves as a suburban hub for nearby urban communities.

Geographically, Imus is surrounded by several northern Cavite municipalities and is connected to Metro Manila via major roads, including the Aguinaldo Highway and other regional thoroughfares. The area features a mix of residential neighborhoods and commercial development, reflecting Cavite’s growth as part of the expanding Manila metropolitan region."
74,"Thailand has won a total of 35 medals at the Summer Olympics through Tokyo 2020, comprised of 9 golds, 9 silvers, and 17 bronzes. The medals come from a variety of sports, with boxing accounting for the largest share, complemented by performances in weightlifting and taekwondo among others.

Medal success for Thailand has occurred across several Games since its early appearances, reflecting a pattern where boxing has traditionally been the strongest contributor. The total can change with each Olympic cycle, such as the Paris 2024 Games. If a precise, up-to-date figure is needed, it can be checked on the official Olympic website or the Thailand at the Olympics page; I can provide the latest total upon request."
75,"The Dead Kennedys are regarded as a pivotal force in punk for their combination of blistering, fast-paced music with sharp, fearless political satire. Emerging from the early San Francisco scene, they fused hardcore energy with surf-rock-like guitar hooks and sudden tempo shifts, expanding the sonic vocabulary of punk. Lyrically, Jello Biafra delivered literate, acerbic critiques of American politics, media manipulation, war, consumer culture, and privilege, turning songs like Holiday in Cambodia and Kill the Poor into punchy, memorable vehicles for social critique. Their albums, including Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables (1980) and the early 1980s outputs Plastic Surgery Disasters (1982) and In God We Trust, Inc. (1981), demonstrated that punk could be both artistically inventive and politically pointed.

Beyond music, the Dead Kennedys helped shape punk culture through a DIY ethos and independent distribution via Alternative Tentacles. A defining moment was the Frankenchrist release (1985), whose controversial H.R. Giger artwork sparked a landmark obscenity trial and highlighted battles over censorship in art and music. This episode underscored a broader commitment to free expression and fed a generation of artists who used punk as a platform for outspoken critique. The band’s willingness to confront powerful ideas with wit and nerve influenced countless later acts and reinforced punk’s potential as a force for political and social commentary, not just rebellion.

In the years since, the Dead Kennedys’ influence persists in the ongoing lineage of politically minded punk and indie rock. Their approach—rapid, provocative songs paired with a clear stance on censorship and corporate power—continues to inspire bands that seek to fuse sharp satire with aggressive music. The legacy also extends to the enduring importance of independent labels, zine culture, and artist-led distribution as viable paths for creative expression, ensuring their role in the history of punk remains influential and relevant today."
76,"Scotland, Texas is a very small town, with a population of around 300 residents. Because numbers are updated periodically, the exact count can vary slightly from year to year.

Located in northeast Texas, it represents one of the many small rural communities in the region. Population figures are routinely revised by the U.S. Census Bureau, so the precise current number is best obtained from their QuickFacts page for Scotland city, Texas.

If desired, additional context can be provided, such as historical population trends or a comparison with nearby towns."
77,"Hans Lippershey, a Dutch spectacle maker from the early 17th century, is credited with developing the first practical telescope in 1608. He demonstrated the device in The Hague and filed a patent claim, marking one of the earliest known attempts to protect an invention in this new age of scientific instrumentation. Although the patent was not granted and the invention was quickly subject to competing claims (notably by Jacob Metius), the episode helped establish the telescope as a transformative scientific tool and popularized the idea of lens-based observation on a broad scale.

The invention's significance lies in its catalytic role for theScientific Revolution. The telescope opened up celestial observation in unprecedented detail, paving the way for key discoveries and new questions in astronomy. Galileo's subsequent improvements and observations—such as studying the moons of Jupiter, the phases of Venus, and the roughness of the Moon's surface—propelled forward humanity’s understanding of the cosmos. Beyond astronomy, telescope-like optics advanced navigation, surveying, and various branches of science, contributing to a lasting shift in how the natural world was studied. The story also highlights early modern innovation and the complex interplay between invention, competition, and the spread of knowledge, with Lippershey’s name becoming emblematic of the invention of the telescope even as multiple claimants and ongoing refinements followed."
78,"Drubec may refer to more than one locality, or to a place with a similar name in different countries. Without specifying the country, region, and whether it is a commune, town, or village, the exact population cannot be determined.

To obtain the precise figure, consult official demographic sources for the relevant country. For France, the quickest route is INSEE, which publishes the latest “population légale” by commune along with the commune’s INSEE code. If the location is elsewhere, use the national statistics office (for example, the U.S. Census Bureau in the United States, Statistics Canada in Canada, ISTAT in Italy) or the municipality’s own site. Wikipedia can also provide a current figure with cited sources, but the primary source should be the official statistics office or local government.

If the country or region is provided, the exact population figure can be retrieved and cited, along with the year of the data. Also note that small places may have multiple nearby localities with similar names or may be administratively grouped within larger intercommunal structures, which can affect how population is reported."
79,"Mazaris is generally regarded as the author of a short Greek dialogue commonly known as Mazaris the Notary or Mazaris’ Discourse to the Dead. The exact date of the work is not known, and the author itself is anonymous. Scholarly consensus places the composition in the late Byzantine or early post‑ Byzantine period, with most scholars dating it to the 14th or 15th centuries. The dating rests on linguistic and stylistic features, as well as the manuscript and transmission history rather than on an explicit internal date.

Because the text itself provides no concrete timestamp, dating relies on philological and codicological evidence rather than a clear publication record. The work fits into a later medieval Greek literary milieu, often treated as a satirical or didactic dialogue about death and fate. Its anonymous authorship and uncertain provenance have led to a range of estimates, but the prevailing view situates Mazaris’ writing firmly in the late medieval period. If desired, a follow‑up can outline the main scholarly viewpoints and summarize how manuscript evidence and linguistic analysis shape these dating possibilities, along with a brief note on the text’s themes and influence."
80,"Jeff Daniels has won two Primetime Emmy Awards.

Beyond the wins, he has received additional Emmy nominations that reflect a varied television career across miniseries and drama series, in addition to his extensive work in film and on stage. If exact years and programs are desired, those details can be provided."
81,"""You Can't Do That"" was written by John Lennon and is credited to Lennon–McCartney. It appears on the Beatles’ 1964 album A Hard Day’s Night (and was featured in the accompanying film). The Lennon–McCartney credit was the standard for most Beatles songs, even when one member wrote the bulk of the music and lyrics.

The lyrics deal with jealousy and admonition toward a lover who might be unfaithful, delivered in Lennon's distinctive vocal style with a punchy, rock-and-R&B influenced arrangement. The track illustrates the era’s typical collaboration dynamic, where Lennon’s sharp, confrontational energy sits alongside the broader Lennon–McCartney songwriting partnership that defined much of the group's catalog."
82,"Venlo municipality is home to roughly 100,000 residents. The most recent official figure from Statistics Netherlands (CBS) places the population at about 101,000 as of January 2023. Population counts are updated regularly and can vary slightly with births, deaths, and migration.

The total figure covers the city of Venlo as well as several surrounding towns and villages such as Blerick and Tegelen. The urban core constitutes part of the area, while the larger municipality extends further across southeast Limburg near the German border. For the exact current number, consult CBS StatLine or the Venlo municipal website, which publish updated population figures on a regular basis."
83,"Eino Uusitalo held the role of a member of the Parliament of Finland (Eduskunta).

As a member of parliament, he participated in national legislative work, representing constituents and contributing to policy through committee work and voting on laws. The Eduskunta serves as Finland’s primary legislative authority, and holding a seat is considered a central and influential political position. If more detail is desired, such as the exact terms of service or party affiliation, those specifics can be provided."
84,"Silent reading, often called sustained silent reading, is encouraged in many classrooms because it gives students time to practice reading in a low-pressure, self-directed way. It helps build reading fluency by letting learners read at their own pace, which supports automatic word recognition, smoother pacing, and better prosody. As students encounter new vocabulary in meaningful contexts, their word knowledge grows; with time, comprehension improves because they have more opportunities to apply strategies like predicting, inferring, and monitoring understanding. Silent reading also fosters independence and intrinsic motivation, since students can choose texts that match their interests, contributing to a positive reading culture in the room. Additionally, it offers equitable practice for diverse learners and can reduce anxiety by providing a calm, focused environment for reading.

Effective implementation combines silent reading with explicit instruction and purposeful follow-up. A consistent daily duration (for example, 10–15 minutes) paired with accountable practices such as reading journals, quick conferences, or brief strategy checks helps ensure instructional value. Access to a wide range of texts—varying in genre, length, and difficulty, in both print and digital formats—supports choosing books that engage different readers. Balancing silent reading with guided or shared reading, mini-lessons on specific strategies, and post-reading activities like book talks or response prompts strengthens comprehension and keeps skills working beyond the individual practice. For multilingual learners and readers who struggle, providing leveled texts, audio supports, and targeted strategy instruction enhances effectiveness without diminishing autonomy.

To maximize benefits, silent reading should not stand alone as the sole literacy activity. It works best as part of a broader literacy program that includes regular teacher demonstrations of reading strategies, opportunities for discussion, and opportunities to connect reading to writing and real-world topics. Creating a welcoming classroom library, celebrating reading, and periodically assessing progress through informal inventories or conferences helps sustain engagement and growth. If distractions arise, establishing a quiet, well-defined reading area and teaching self-regulation strategies can preserve the focus and allow all students to develop sustained attention over time."
85,"The role that made Richard Chamberlain a television star was Dr. James Kildare in the long-running series Dr. Kildare (1961–1966). Portraying the idealistic young medical intern-turned-doctor, Chamberlain became a household name and one of television’s leading men, quickly rising to teen idol status in the 1960s.

The success of Dr. Kildare established Chamberlain as a durable television figure, leading to additional high-profile projects later in his career. He continued to command attention in major miniseries and series, including Shogun (1980) as John Blackthorne and The Thorn Birds (1982/83) as Father Ralph de Bricassart, reinforcing his reputation as a prominent TV star beyond the Kildare role."
86,"The Inspection Générale des Finances (IGF) is a relatively small inspectorate within the French Ministry of Economy and Finance. The core body—the corps of Inspecteurs généraux des finances—typically numbers around sixty to seventy members. If the broader IGF group is counted, including Inspecteurs des finances and other staff who work under the IGF, the total size is in the low hundreds. The exact headcount changes over time due to appointments, retirements, and organizational adjustments.

The IGF operates as a lean, senior-tier body focused on auditing and evaluating financial administration and public policy. Members are drawn from advanced civil-service ranks through competitive selection, and many advance from the broader corps of financial inspectors after a lengthy career path in various ministries and agencies. The leadership is provided by an Inspecteur général des finances who oversees missions and strategic directions.

For the most current figure, consult official sources such as the ministry’s publications or the IGF’s pages. The ministry’s annual activity reports or the staff directory (annuaire) typically publish up-to-date numbers. If needed, a direct inquiry to the Ministry of Economy and Finance or the IGF itself can yield the latest headcount."
87,"Christa McAuliffe was 37 years old at the time of her death. Born on September 2, 1948, she died on January 28, 1986, making her 37 when the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster occurred.

She was selected as the first teacher to travel into space as part of NASA’s Teacher in Space Project and flew aboard the Space Shuttle Challenger on mission STS-51-L. The tragedy that day led to lasting changes in space safety practices and the creation of educational initiatives in her memory. Her legacy lives on in programs and scholarships that encourage science and space exploration, including the Challenger Center for Space Science Education."
88,"Two living languages belong to the Nakh group: Chechen and Ingush. They form the Nakh branch of the Nakh-Daghestanian (Northeast Caucasian) language family.

These languages are spoken primarily in the North Caucasus region of Russia (Chechnya and Ingushetia) and by diaspora communities elsewhere. They are related but distinct languages with their own grammars and vocabularies, and each has multiple dialects. In standard linguistic classifications, the Nakh group comprises two languages: Chechen and Ingush."
89,"Three men are lynched. In The Ox-Bow Incident, a posse hangs three suspects after a rancher is killed, a decision that drives the story’s examination of mob justice and the dangers of condemning someone without due process.

The work—originally a 1940 novel by Walter Van Tilburg Clark and later adapted into a 1943 film—uses this incident to critique vigilante justice and explore moral responsibility. The narrative centers on the consequences of the mob’s actions, the questions of guilt and innocence, and the heavy toll exacted on a community when judgment is left to emotion rather than law."
90,"Poweshiek County, Iowa has a population of roughly 18,000 residents. This rural county, located in central Iowa, includes communities such as Montezuma (the county seat) and Brooklyn, and is characterized by a relatively small, spread-out population.

According to U.S. Census Bureau data, the population has remained in the low-to-mid 18,000s in recent years, with the 2020 decennial census and subsequent annual estimates reflecting a similar range. For an exact figure by year—including the precise 2020 census count and the latest annual estimate—the Census Bureau’s QuickFacts for Poweshiek County, Iowa provides the official numbers. If a specific year is needed, the exact figure can be provided."
91,"Anvar Chingizoglu was from Azerbaijan; he is regarded as an Azerbaijani historian and ethnographer.

He is widely known for his work on the peoples of the Caucasus and the Turkic world, as well as for popularizing historical and ethnographic knowledge in Azerbaijan. His writings often blend scholarly research with accessible narratives about regional history, culture, and demography, contributing to a broader understanding of Azerbaijani heritage and related Turkic cultures.

Note that the name can appear with different transliterations, such as Anvar Çingizoğlu or Anvar Changizoglu, depending on the language system used. For further reading, look for Azerbaijani encyclopedias or cultural-historical publications that profile prominent Azerbaijani scholars and their contributions to regional history and ethnography."
92,"Auer (German name) is known as Ora in Italian, and it is a municipality in South Tyrol. The population is about 3,000 residents, with the exact number varying slightly from year to year.

Located in the Adige valley southeast of Bolzano, Ora sits within the bilingual and culturally diverse South Tyrol, where German is the predominant language and Italian is widely used in administration and daily life. The area features a mix of agriculture, including fruit and vineyards, and serves as part of the broader northern Italian wine and tourism region. For the precise current population figure, consult the latest ISTAT data or the municipality’s official statistics."
93,"Linton is the name of several different places around the world, so identifying a single location depends on the country or region in question. Without a specific context, it is not possible to point to one definitive place.

Notable Lintons include: Linton, Indiana in the United States, which is the county seat of Greene County in southwestern Indiana; Linton, North Dakota in the United States, a city in Emmons County; Linton, Cambridgeshire in England, a village near Cambridge; Linton, Suffolk in England, a village in the Mid Suffolk district; and Linton-on-Ouse in North Yorkshire, England, a village in that region. The name is common in England and the United States, and there are other places with similar names as well. The exact location can be confirmed by specifying the country or nearby towns. If more detail is available, precise coordinates or a map reference can be provided."
94,"In the wild, bowfin typically live about 10–15 years. Many individuals reach their teens, and under favorable conditions some can survive into their early 20s. A few reports suggest ages around 25 years, but such records are uncommon and age estimates usually come from examining growth rings on hard structures like otoliths or scales rather than easy field observations.

Lifespan is affected by habitat quality, prey availability, predation, seasonal conditions, and fishing pressure. Bowfin are hardy and capable of breathing air with a gas bladder, which helps them endure low-oxygen waters and fluctuating conditions, but this resilience does not guarantee longer lives. They inhabit slow-moving rivers, lakes, and swamps across much of the eastern United States and parts of Canada, where their role as predators helps shape aquatic ecosystems. Overall, the bowfin is not globally threatened, but local populations can suffer from habitat loss and drought; understanding their longevity helps illuminate their ecological role and population dynamics."
95,"There isn’t a single, universally known Jerome Cooper whose age at death is universally fixed, because multiple individuals share the name. Without additional context—such as occupation, nationality, or the era in which he lived—it isn’t possible to determine precisely which Jerome Cooper is being referred to or his age at death.

To obtain an accurate answer, identify the correct person and consult reliable biographical sources. Useful steps include checking obituaries in major newspapers, authoritative biographical dictionaries, and reputable online databases or encyclopedias. If there is a known association (for example, a musical group, a field like sports or academia, or a rough birth/death period), that detail will help pinpoint the right Jerome Cooper and confirm his dates.

If the intended subject is the American jazz percussionist commonly associated with avant-garde projects, providing any distinguishing detail (such as a band, collaborate, or approximate decade of activity) will enable a precise determination of his age at death and a brief summary of his life and work."
96,"Alex Rodriguez hit 696 home runs over his Major League Baseball career. The total reflects regular-season play across his 1994–2016 tenure, spanning time with the Seattle Mariners, Texas Rangers, and New York Yankees.

With 696 homers, he ranks fourth on the all-time MLB list, behind Barry Bonds (762), Hank Aaron (755), and Babe Ruth (714). This figure highlights his place as one of the game's greatest power hitters. It’s worth noting that this count covers regular-season rounds; postseason home runs are counted separately."
97,"The name “Carlo Fonseka” does not correspond to a widely recognized public figure with a clearly documented political ideology in standard historical sources. The spelling may reflect a confusion with another figure with a similar name, such as Carlos Fonseca Amador, a well-known Nicaraguan revolutionary, or Sarath Fonseka, a Sri Lankan general turned politician. Without additional context (country, time period, or spelling), identifying a specific political ideology attributed to “Carlo Fonseka” cannot be stated with confidence.

If the intended figure is Carlos Fonseca Amador, the answer is that he strongly supported Marxist-Leninist socialism as part of the Sandinista movement in Nicaragua. Fonseca helped found the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) and advocated anti-imperialist, socialist revolution aimed at overthrowing dictatorship and restructuring society along leftist lines. The Sandinistas pursued reforms such as land redistribution, literacy campaigns, and social programs, situating their ideology within a broader Marxist-Leninist and liberation-theology-inspired leftist tradition.

For clarity, providing the correct spelling or additional identifying details (country, era, or notable works) would help pinpoint the exact figure and the corresponding ideological emphasis."
98,"Belinda was written by Maria Edgeworth and first published in 1801. It is an early 19th-century novel of manners that centers on the virtuous heroine Belinda, exploring themes of education, social behavior, and marriage within the English gentry.

Edgeworth, an Irish-English author, is known for her practical, realist approach to fiction and for promoting thoughtful education for women. Belinda engages with questions of domestic virtue, class, and moral development, often balancing sentiment with a critique of conventional gender expectations. It sits alongside her other notable works, such as Castle Rackrent and Patronage, as part of her broader project of shaping readers’ ideas about conduct and society.

If a different work titled Belinda is intended, note that there are other novels with the same title by different authors (for example, later Gothic and romantic works). The Edgeworth novel is the most frequently referenced when the question concerns a classic “Belinda.” The Edgeworth text is in the public domain and available online, including on Project Gutenberg, should further reading be desired."
99,"There are several releases titled Calling Time by different artists, spanning genres from rock to folk to hip-hop. Across these works, the concept of time is usually used as a lens for examining personal decisions, aging, and broader social or political issues. Common threads include a sense of urgency, reckoning, and the feeling that time is running out to change things, forgive, or take action.

The precise meaning depends on the artist and context. A Calling Time album may function as a concept piece or as a collection in which time serves as a central motif. Look for recurring musical ideas, a progression from reflective, slower songs to more urgent, driving tracks, and a track-by-track or overarching narrative. Production choices—tempo shifts, mood changes, instrumentation—often reinforce the theme of time and its pressure.

If the exact artist and release year are known, a targeted summary can cover the album’s main themes, standout tracks, and critical reception. In general, analysis can explore how time is portrayed—whether as mortality, memory, countdowns, or calls to action—and how the closing moments resolve or leave unresolved the questions raised. Context from the artist’s broader body of work and the era of release can also shed light on why time emerged as a central topic. If desired, that information can be accompanied by a concise, track-by-track overview."
